	// introduces how the MBCMS functions.

<div style="padding:10px;">
The MB:CMS allows you to edit areas of your site, pre-determinied by the site Administrator.
<p>
<table width="100%">
<tr><td valign="top" style="text-align:justify; padding-right:5px;">
<b>SOME GUIDELINES TO FOLLOW:</b><p>
Note the image on the right. This is a sample of what a MB:CMS list page looks like. It lists all content within that particular section, else a list of all categories that can be drilled down to a specific content. 
The tabs on the top indicate where you are. If you click on a title of some content, you'll be at the edit tab, and will see a form that allows you to edit the selected content (see below). Click on the 'add' tab to add new content where applicable.

<tr><td valign="top" style="text-align:justify; padding-right:5px;">
<b>ADD/EDIT PAGE KEY:</b><p>
A. Some pages have page-specific notes, such as required information, etc. These notes and rules must be followed for site content to display as expected.<p>
B. Some fields have field-specific notes, such as the format of the field data. If the format of field data is not followed as specified in these fields, content will not function as expected on the live site.<p>
C. Some fields allow you to build HTML via a Word Processer-like editor interface. A computer with any modern browser (Safari on Mac not supported) is required to use the editor, else you'll see HTML. You may edit within the HTML mode if you'd like, else you need to use Internet Explorer 6+, Mozilla 1.5+, Firefox 1+ or comparable browser.
<p><b>Note:</b> <i>Copy and pasting text from anything but a plain text editor into the description field (with the Rich Text Editor) will product unexpected results and is not preferred.</i>
